# How to do an inspiring technical presentation in 5 minutes only.

2. 3 slides Only :
    - **The objective WHY**: Why you want to present this thing. What does it bring to the company or the audience?
    - **The mechanics HOW**: How does it work? What are the technical details? Go as deep as the audience can follow. Prefer a schema 
    - **The application WHAT**: What can we do with it? What are the benefits? What are the use cases?
